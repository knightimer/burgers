Node Express Handlebars

A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

## How it works:

Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devoured button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the opposite side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
